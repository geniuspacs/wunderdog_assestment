# WUNDERDOG ASSESTMENT

This is a technical task made by Eugenio PÃ¡ez for the company Wunderdog.

The task is a Rock-Paper-Scissor game which consist of 3 partes:

* API: Developed with NodeJS implementing Typescript
* APP: Web application developed with React using Typescript
* Types: little library which contain shared interfaces between projects

As you can see this is a monorepo, so you can run commands under any determined workspace

## Steps to run

We will explain how to run the project in development mode. To run as production, you can see package.json (scripts section).

#### IMPORTANT: Please copy .env file inside each workspace directory and fill the environment variables. The values contained in example.env are valid so you can try with that values

### API

1.- Run `npm install`

2.- Run `npm run dev:api` to start the server. It will compile previously the types library


### APP

1.- Run `npm install`

2.- Run `npm run dev:app` to start the server. It will compile previously the types library


#### Note: I know is not excuse but I had not time to make the unit test, but the environment is ready to do it and also I included an example of a basic unit test (using jest) inside API workspace.
